üìä Practical Factor Analysis in Python
This Python notebook was created as part of my studies: bachelor's degree in Data Science at the Universitat Internacional de la Rioja (UNIR). It walks through a hands-on implementation of Factor Analysis , a powerful statistical method for dimensionality reduction , using real-world data.

üéØ Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how Factor Analysis works by forming linear combinations of variables to uncover latent (hidden) factors.
- Explore both unrotated and Varimax-rotated solutions for better interpretability.
- Visualize factor loadings and uniqueness values to assess how well each variable fits into the model.
I hope this material helps other students and self-learners who are exploring statistical methods in machine learning or data preprocessing.

üìÅ What You'll Find Here
The notebook includes:
- A practical walkthrough of Factor Analysis using scikit-learn.
- Heatmaps showing factor loadings before and after rotation.
- Interpretation of communalities and uniqueness .
- Full documentation via Jupyter Markdown cells explaining each step clearly.
All visualizations and explanations are designed to help readers understand the process of extracting and interpreting latent variables from multivariate datasets.
